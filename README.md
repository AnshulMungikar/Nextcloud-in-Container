# Nextcloud-in-Container
Installing nextcloud in an proxmox container.
### What is this about?
I will be installing nextcloud in an proxmox container and using tailscale to connect to the nextcloud instance.

### Reason to do this:
I am installing nextcloud in an container because my server is running on old hardware (Intel core 2 duo and 8gb ram). As running nextcloud ina container i more lightweight that running it in a virtual machine.
